The visual style and theme of Maryam's Bakery were heavily inspired by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The game draws from the whimsical, chocolate-filled world created by Roald Dahl, especially the iconic Wonka Bars and their coveted Golden Tickets.

In the movie, the Golden Ticket served as a magical entrance into Willy Wonka’s factory – a place where secret recipes, fantastical sweets, and imagination came to life.

In a similar spirit, completing all three levels of the game rewards players with a “Claim Prize” button – a nod to the Golden Ticket — which whisks them away to a secret recipe page. 

There, instead of Everlasting Gobstoppers or Fizzy Lifting Drinks, players are treated to real favorite recipes:

Fudgy Brownies, Gooey Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Rich Chocolate Cake

Just like the movie, it’s a **sweet** reward for curiosity, perseverance, and a love of chocolate!
